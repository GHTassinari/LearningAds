# LearningAds
A simple project using HTML, CSS and Javascript to create a landing page that doesn't have anything, to test Facebook and Google ads.

I will include google ads and facebook ads script to the page, so when I open the Vercel page, the extension will say that I have the script included in the page.

The project is in development, at the moment.
