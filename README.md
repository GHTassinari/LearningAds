# LearningAds
A simple web project to create a landing page that doesn't have anything, to test Facebook and Google ads.

I will include google ads and facebook ads script to the page, so when I open the Vercel page, the extension will say that I have the script included in the page.

Rigth now it includes:

- Every time a user enters the page, or click the "Landing Page" button, it will send me an event on the Facebook business page. The landing page button counts as a register event.
- Every time the user enters in "Index.html" or in "Sucess.html" it sends me some details in Google ads.
- It also includes Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager.

There are campaign pages in this project, that will have some ads, and that aren't acessible through the first landing page.
Their links are:

Facebook Campaigns:

- Campaign 1:
- Campaign 2:
- Campaign 3:

Google Ads Campaigns:
