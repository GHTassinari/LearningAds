# LearningAds
A simple web project to create a landing page that doesn't have anything, to test Facebook and Google ads.

I will include google ads and facebook ads script to the page, so when I open the Vercel page, the extension will say that I have the script included in the page.

Rigth now it includes:

- Every time a user enters the page, or click the "Landing Page" button, it will send me an event on the Facebook business page. The landing page button counts as a register event.
- Every time the user enters in "Index.html" or in "Sucess.html" it sends me some details in Google ads.
- It also includes Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager.
